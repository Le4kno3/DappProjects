# lottery-react-contract-SCD
 - An extension to lottery project, to give a GUI using React and web3.js library with Metamask.
 - This not a standalone project. You need lottery project to deploy a smart contract to Rinkby network. You need to record the address of contract and ABI
 - Then you need to integrate and connect the lottery-react-project with Metamask, in order to use the account to process transactions.
 - This project uses existing smart contracts. It just creates a web interface using react and web3.js to interact with smart contract.
