# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

First, rename the .env-example file to .env and fill the required variable values.

Then, Try running some of the following commands in the PWD of the project to deploy the smart contract to polygon testnet:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

Finally visit, `https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/` and search the contract address.
